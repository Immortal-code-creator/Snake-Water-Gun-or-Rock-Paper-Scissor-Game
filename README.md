# Snake-Water-Gun & Rock-Paper-Scissors Game (Python)

A simple command-line based gaming project that allows users to play two classic games:

-Snake-Water-Gun

-Rock-Paper-Scissors

with multiple difficulty levels and real-time score tracking against the computer.

## Description

The Snake-Water-Gun & Rock-Paper-Scissors Game is a Python-based console application where the user can choose between two different games and compete with the computer. Each game has three difficulty modes:

-Easy

-Medium

-Hard

The player selects their move every round while the computer randomly chooses its move using Python’s built-in random module. Scores are displayed after every round, and the first player to reach the target score wins the match.
This project is designed to strengthen understanding of Python fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, functions, user input validation, and game logic.

## Dependencies

-Python 3.10 or above

-Supported Operating Systems:

.Windows

.Linux

.macOS

-Built-in Python Modules Used:

.random

.No external libraries are required.

-Concepts Used

-Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)

.Loops (while)

.User Input Handling

.Random Module

.Game Logic

.Score Tracking System

.Basic Error Handling

.Menu-driven Programming

## How the Program Works

-The user enters their name.

-The program asks the user to choose a game:

.Press 1 → Snake-Water-Gun

.Press 2 → Rock-Paper-Scissors

-The user selects a difficulty mode:

.Easy

.Medium

.Hard

-Each mode has a different target score to win.

In every round:

.The user enters their choice.

.The computer randomly selects its choice.

.The winner of the round is decided.

.Scores are updated and displayed.

.The game continues until either the user or the computer reaches the target score.

Final scores and the winner are displayed.
